ISO
please be aware we cannot summaries this like the CAA proposal at this time as we would need permission to do an in depth summary at this time.

The ISO proposal was a proposal to create international standards for assistance dogs. It primarily asked to standardise terminology, health and welfare, breeding and puppy development,training, client services, assistance dog professionals, comformity assessments ,and accessibility. It is important to remember that standards are not equivalent to law ,but does have the possibility to influence it. 
he proposal asked for stakeholders to make comments about it. Some publically available answers can be found below. In the UK, many reponses were taken to the BSI which had a vote in the matter. The proposal was eventually voted down

The worldwide reaction to the proposal from both the commuity and organisations was widely negative. The main points brought up repeatedly were the financial and technical issues as well as the limited cover of owner trained assistance dogs. In the USA, it was also a repeated point around miniature horses was also brought up as they are an assistance animal in the States.
