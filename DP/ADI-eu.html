ADI/ADeu

Assistance Dogs International or the ADI is the main coalition in the world for assistance dogs and the leading accrediting body for assistance dog programmes. 
There are 130+ ADI accredited organisations worldwide and 20,000+ assistance dogs placed by the organisations. The ADI are on of the only bodies that will accredit assistance
dog organisations. This means they will make sure they adhere to certain standards of training,education and service among other things they must also be a charitable organisation.
To become an member organisation, an org must become a candidate programme and be in good standing for 2yrs. They must achieve this by 5yrs. The only other way to  become an ADI accreditted member is to be an IGDF organisation.

In some countries only ADI/IGDF assistance dogs are recognised by law. If you are looking to travel with an assistance dog you may want to check with the national law before choosing an organisation.
