	  <a><h1>Information on Assistance Dogs</h1></a>
<p>Assistance dogs are an important day-to-day aid for over 7000 Disabled people in the UK. They facilitate access to many facilities and services including education, shops and leisure activities. These dogs are protected by law when accompanied by a Disabled person, and it is considered indirect discrimination when prohibiting access to an assistance dog except in the most exceptional circumstances (eg. ICU, kitchens, animal enclosures). This is because assistance dogs are classified as 'auxiliary aids' and it is a 'reasonable adjustment' to allow them access by the Equality Act 2010 (England, Scotland, Wales) and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Northern Ireland). It is important to remember that you can not deny access to an assistance dog partnership on religous grounds or allergies* </p>

<p> Assistance dogs can be any breed and can be for any disability, not just visible ones but invisible ones too. 

<b>How do I recognise an assistance dog?</b>

<p>An assistance dog usually will be wearing a piece of clothing or 'gear' that states they're an assistance dog, such as vests, bandannas and collars. Some assistance dogs may also carry identification but this is not required by law. You cannot deny access to an assistance dog because they aren't wearing any clothing or don't have certification, ID or registration as neither is required by law. The only way to recognise an assistance dog formally is through there behaviour. All assistance dogs should display calm and focused behaviour and should not disturb other customers. Please remember  assistance dogs are not robots and may make mistakes from time to time. You may also want to ask the question 'is your dog an assistance dog?', most partnerships will happily answer this. Do not enquire about the nature of the persons disability as it is private information. If an assistance dog is misbehaving you can ask the dog to leave.</p>

<b>How do I interact with an assistance dog? </b>
<p> When interacting with an assistance dog partnership, talk to the handler and not the dog and do not distract the dog. It is important that the dog is not distracted as they may miss an alert or task which can put the Disabled handler at risk. If you see another customer distracting an assistance dog without permission, please ask them to stop.</p>

<b> What can I do to make assistance dog partnerships feel welcome? </b>
<p>Making sure that your signs are correct and inlign with current legislation can make a world of difference. Signs that say 'registered assistance dogs only' or 'no dogs except guide dogs' are not reflective of the law and can cause increased anxiety for partnerships. A simple sign that says 'no dogs except assistance dogs' or 'assistance dogs welcome' is the simplest way to make partnerships feel welcome. CATE runs a sub-project called 'Give A Dog A Sign' which provides free templates of signs which can be found here. Another way is to make sure that you business is accessible and a wheelchair user with an assistance dog would be able to get around with ease. This may be hard for smaller premises, so making sure that a wheelchair user without an assistance dog would be able to get through should be a minimum.</p>

<p>*There is an exception for taxi or private hire vehicle drivers who have a exemption certificate from their GP saying they have a dog allergy. If another customer has a dog allergy, you should accomadate both them and the assistance dog partnership</p>
