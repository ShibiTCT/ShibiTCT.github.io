	<h1>Types of training</h1>
	<p> Assistance dogs are usually trained by one or a mix of 3 ways. These different types do not describe the method of training but who trained the dog. By law, anyone can train an assistance dog.</p>
	<h3>Programme trained</h3>
	<p> This is the stereotypical type of assistance dog training. This is where a organisation trains an assistance dog for a Disabled person and the Disabled person isn't involved for the majority of training. Different programmes have different amounts of handler involvement and processes. Some assistance dog programmes involve the handler from puppyhood, whilst others wait to match a partnership till they have completed basic training. Rarely organisations will place dogs completely trained already as most disabilities are variable require training specific to the person instead of specific to the condition. Occassionally, this is how guide dogs and hearing dogs are placed, though this varies by programme. Most programmes expect you to keep up the training and will tell you how to do that as well as how to look after your dog.</p>
	<p> The cost of programme trained dogs varies by programme, with some being free and others costing up to or over Â£9500. As far as we are aware all programmes will require you to cover general dog expenses while to dog is placed with you.</p>
	<h3>Aided-Owner Trained</h3>
	<p> This type of training is called different things by different people. This type of training is where you are the primary trainer of the assistance dog but there is considerable input and guidance by an assistance dog trainer or orgnisation. You will have to find a dog with the right temperemant to train and are responsible for the training. This can be a hard process and not all dogs will make it. It can be cheaper than programmes ,but not always. Some people will find that programmes do not cover their conditions and so will go for this or owner training as the only options. Already owned pet dogs can also be trained as assistance dogs if they are the right temperament</p>
	<h3>Owner Trained</h3>
	<p>This is where the training is done by the individual with less input from a trainer or organisation than A-OT. This type is usually only recommended for individuals who have experience with training dogs or are confined by complex cicumstances. This type of training allows the most control on how you train your dog which many people like.</p>
