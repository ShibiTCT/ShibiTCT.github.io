    <h1> What is CATE?</h1>

<p>CATE or Canine Access To Education is a project by me, ShibiTCT. It is meant to act as a resource for people to find out more about assistance dogs and to help Disabled people find an Assistance dog provider, organisation or someone who can help with assistance dog training.
The project is currently run just by me but I rely heavily on the input of other people to help make sure the site is as best quality as it possibly can be. </p>



    <h4>About me</h4>
<p>	
CATE or Canine Access To Education, was orginally meant to be a CIC to help with access issues caused by university policies, hence the name. I realised quite quickly I didn't have the skills to sustain such a project so I abandoned the project. Over the course of a couple years I have helped people on twitter to find assistance dog organisations or to educate people on the guidance surrounding them. After a while of recalling organisations from memory, I decided that creating a list of organisations would be beneficial so that I didn't miss any. This list was originally a document I had for personal use which I could use when answering questions, then I realised that it would be more useful if it was available for public use. So I decided that creating a website would be the best thing to do, as sending around a document would be unpractical.The first notes on CATE I can find were from December 2020, though the github wasn't created to mid-March 2021. The project is currently still run individually by me. 
	
I'm a 17yro Autistic individual who has a few other disbilities like fibromyalgia and OCD. Assistance dogs are unsurprisingly a long-term special interest of mine which I have now had for 2-3yrs. I have had an assistance dog in training since Februaury 2021 when we rehomed a 1yro Labrador. I had only minor advocacy skills before CATE in situations both on and offline where I had to advocate for myself. The Autistic, Assistance dog, and wider Disabled community have all been massive reasons for why my advocacy has improved so much. I have learnt a lot since running the project including the importance of organisation skills and not rushing into things.
	
Project CATE has helped me to develop my website building skills drastically. I originally learnt basic HTML and W3.CSS for a website for a Hackathon project in 2020, but my skills have improved a lot over the months of working on CATE and can happily say that CSS has joined my skill set. If you know anything about programming you will probably realise how stupid it is to learn W3.CSS before CSS, so please forgive me. You will may also spot the occassional Javascript feature on this site too. If you ever want to talk more about static website building feel free to contact CATE's social media pages.
	
I have attended the Stanford Neurodiversity Projects Reasearch,Eduacation and Adovocacy Camp for Highschoolers (SNP REACH) in 2021 as the only UK student. This helped me improve my advocacy skills as well as gave me better insight into what advocacy can look like from the perspective of someone who isn't familiar with a concept. Many of the skills I learnt have been transferable to project CATE. My groups project from SNP REACH was creating activities and structure a Neurodiversity Celebration Week which we indend to bring to our schools in 2022, in correllation to the dates of Siena Castellon's week. None of our schools have had a Neurdiversity week, so we hope to establish it as an annual event within our schools. If you are interested in bringing a Neurodiversity celebration week to your school please go to Sienna Castellon's website.

As a note, I find it incredibly important that project CATE remains neutral on most ,but not all, things. This means that my opinion can differ drastically than that of the projects. This is something I hope will be upheld by anyone involved with CATE throughout it's lifetime
