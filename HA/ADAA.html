The Assistance Dog Assessment Association is a charity that was registered in late 2020. It currently has both ADUK and non-ADUK trustees.

According to their decription on the charity commissions website they have a focus on improving education on assistance dogs and provide a public access to 'accredit' for privately trained assistance dogs to improve their confidence in accessing public spaces.

Opinion 
This section does not reflect the opinion of Project CATE

This might be the scheme that the DWP have been involved in, though this is only speculation. This may also be a pinacle moment for air travel, as this may end up being the way that non-ADI/IGDF dogs stop being charged the illegal landing fee that is sometimes charged when rentering the UK. This may also decrease the current issues with university policies around assistance dog.
We have seen different and contrastig reactions from the assitance dog community. Some welcome the public access test and the extra confidence it would bring. Others believe this may lead to mandatory accrediation which may be expensive and unfair. Both sides hold value and I hope we see all opinions taken into account with the evolution of assistance dog standards, even informal ones.
