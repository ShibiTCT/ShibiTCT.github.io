Emotional Support Animals

The term Emotional Support Animal or ESA comes from the USA. In the US, ESAs are a legally recognised animal which has been prescribed to the person to help illeviate the symptoms of a condition through emotional support. They do not have to be trained. These animals are exempt from the no-pet rule in housing and used to be able to travel by plane for free (this changed in 2020/2021). ESAs are  not allowed in non-pet friendly places.
Currently ESAs do not exist in the UK. Some people may choose to label their animal as such but there is no legal benefit to doing so. Please be wary of ESA registry scams as they do not exist within the UK.
There are occasional incedents where an animal that is not an assistance dog is granted access to non-pet housing but this should not be relied on.

Dogs that are assistance dogs are sometimes be labelled as emotional support dogs. If the owner says that there dog is an assistance dog they should be allowed access. Though labelling your assistance dog as an emotional support dog is bad practice, there is no legal requirement for an assistance dog to be labelled as anything specific or at all.
