This is my portfolio of different media I have produced or been a part off

Website development

This site and the site it was built on was hand coded in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 2.4.1 . Originally, it was in W3.CSS but this is no longer a part of the site. There are are JavaScript elements.

I also developed the site CATE UK (<a href="https://www.cateuk.org.uk/"> https://www.cateuk.org.uk </a> ) and know how to use WordPress as this is what the site was built on
