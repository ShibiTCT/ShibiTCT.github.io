The Problem





Sign Examples
ADUK roundel
The ADUK roundel was given out in the late 00's and possibly early 10's. As this roundel has the phrase 'No dogs except registered assistance dogs' this sign isn't suitable for use as there is no assistance dog registry in the UK. The rectangular sign that replaced it sufficently represents the law and reflects this. If you have recieved a sticker from the ADUK a few years ago you may have recieved a leaflet saying to 'Ask for the Assistance Dogs (UK) Identification Book' along with some other information. This leaflet does not reflect the law as identification is not necessarry. Since then assistance dogs UK have updated their information which can be seen through their website assistancedogs.org.uk .
