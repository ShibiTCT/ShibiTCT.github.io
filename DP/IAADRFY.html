    <h1>Is an Assistance dog right for you?</h1>

  <p>  Assistance dogs are a wonderful way to gain back some independence but they are not for everyone. There are many aspects that you may need to consider before you decided it's the right route for you. Here is a few things that we've put together.</p>
    
<h3>Something else will help better</h3>
<p>Assistance dogs are one of many aids that can help you and may not be the best. If something else can help to the same extent of an assistance dog, you should try that first.</p>


   <h3> Responsibility</h3>
<p>When you take on the responsibility of an assistance dog you also take on the responsibility of a dog. This means there is the need to walk the dog, keep up to date with parasite prevention, feed, water the list goes on! If you are getting your dog as a puppy you will also need to train the dog for hours a week and so is a big commitment. If you are with a programme, most will ask you to upkeep training as well though nearly all will help you with that.</p>

    <h3>Emotional Commitment</h3>
You have to be ready emotionally to take on a dog. This means you have to be ready to deal with any health issues that may arise and that can take an emotional toll on you. Additionally, you must be prepared that your dog may wash or retire at any time whether this may be because of a dog attack, health issues or something else, loosing a life-line can be stressful. You must also be ready to deal with the public and uneducated buisnesses. Many people will try and interact with your dog and may try to stop you from entering a facility as they don't know that assistance dogs have access and this can be distressing and annoying. The emotional aspect of having an assistance dog is different for each individual and sometimes it may not be that you are ready for it but you must prepare for it.</p>

    <h3>Costs</h3>
<p>Assistance dogs vary in cost immensly. Some assistance dogs can cost up to Â£9,500 whilst others may be free but you have to pay for general dog upkeep. Most will be somewhere in the middle. Unfortunately, this is often the biggest barrier in getting an assistance dog. If you can't afford it but can pay for the general upkeep of a dog, there are grants available that may be able to help.</p>
