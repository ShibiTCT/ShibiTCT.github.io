What is an Assistance Dog- Public Edition!
An Assistance Dog is a dog trained to assist a Disabled person and they have access to most public places by law. 
Assistance dogs are highly trained and can take years to complete their training. They can be guide dogs, hearing dogs, medical alert/response dogs,autism dogs, psychiatric assistance dogs and mobility assistance dogs, among others.
Many assistance dogs work with people who have invisible disabilities and it's important to remember that just because you can't see the disability doesn't mean it's not there.
It is important not to distract assistance dogs, as they could miss an alert which can cause serious medical repricussions.
Assistance dogs can be any breed, but all should be highly trained. This should mean that they shouldn't sniff produce,bark or jump up on people that are not their handler. It is important to remember that some tasks that assistance dogs can be trained to do may be exceptions to the rule such as an allergen detection dog sniffing something or a dog barking to get their handlers attention. It is also important to remember that assistance dogs are not robots and they do make mistakes and have bad days. As long as a dog continues to be under control they should be assumed to be an assistance dog.
