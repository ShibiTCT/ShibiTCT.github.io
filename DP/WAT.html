			<h1 class="w3-center"><b>What are assistance dogs?</b></h1>
<p> Assistance dogs are dogs trained to assist a Disabled person. These dogs are highly trained and they are allowed in places that a pet dog is not such as supermarkets and other public places. This is called public access and is allowed by it being a reasonable adjustment. There are many types of assistance dogs which help people with a variety of conditions. It is important to remember that they also assist people with hidden disabilities which means you cannot tell whether someone needs an assistance dog or not by just their appearance. They can be trained by anyone, including charities and the Disabled person themself which increases accessibility to these great aids. </p>
		<p> Assistance dogs are a reasonable adjustment covered by the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents">Equality Act 2010</a> if you live are in England, Scotland or Wales. If you live in Northern Ireland they are a reasonable adjustment by the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/50/contents">Disability Discrimination Act 1995</a>. 
		It is to note that as far as we are aware, the definition of assistance dog found in the private hire and taxis vehicle section does not apply to rest of the act, meaning for most scenarios there is not a formal definition of assistance dog. The ADUK have also stated this in the Assistance Dogs:Issues document which can be found in <a href="Res.html">our resources section</a>. We know by the Equality Act 2010 that they are considered an auxillary aid.
	The definition is occassionally found elsewhere, such as the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/12/section/106/enacted">Anti-social behaviours act 2014</a>, which made it illegal for a dog to attack an assistance dog. The Equality Act 2010 protects the Disabled person and through them the assistance dog, the assistance dog does not have protection by itself.</p>
	<p> Currently the only formal guidance we have are <a href="Res.html">EHRC guides which can be found here</a></p>
