      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <h4>What is CATE?</h4>
<p>CATE or Canine Access To Education is a personal project run by ShibiTCT to help educate the public on assistance dogs and to help Disabled people find assistance dog providers and services.</p>
      <h4>Are the organisations on the lists vetted by you?</h4>
<p>No. We do not vet the organisations on our list outside of a quick google search. We do try to find working teams and recent information on each org but this is not always possible especially for the smaller and more specific orgs. We will never confirm the legitimacy of any organisation as this is hard to confirm.</p>
      <h4>What criteria do you use when judging whether an organisation should be on the list?</h4>
<p>There are multiple ways we judge whether an organisation should be on the list. These include recent posts, up-to-date website information and working teams. We sometimes add dog trainers to the list if they have specific assistance dog programmes (eg. a membership based system or have a primary focus in the area) we may move these to a different list later. After recent incidence we have decided that there has to be a clear statement that the dogs trained as assistance dogs as well as people actively working with the organisation before being added to the list, there may be some exceptions but these are always on a case by case basis. As always just because the on the list doesn't mean we endorse the organisation. The list is meant to aid people in their research for an assistance dog not confirm the legitimacy of an org.</p>
      <h4>When will an organisation be taken of the list?</h4>
<p>An organisation may be taken of the list temporarily or permanently due to a number of reasons. An org may be removed temporarily if there is an active enquiry into the organisation by the charity commission or that has been allegations against an org (allegations don't always result on a org being removed, they are assessed on a case-by-case basis). An org may be taken of the list permanently if: the organisation requests it, the org dissolves or no longer exists, stays inactive for 1+ years or there has been proven issues with the org.</p>
      <h4>Why do you use 'We' if it's only one person?</h4>
<p>When speaking through CATE I use 'We' for many reasons. CATE and myself do not always hold the same views. I decided early on that CATE should remain neutral on most things and show a balanced view on most things. I also use 'We' as in the case that CATE changes hands, it means that the next owner doesn't have to change anything to do with pronouns, same for if it ever became an organisation. There may also be instances where multiple people have had input on a page as public input is vital to CATE's upkeep.</p>
      <h4>Can you do a page on ______?</h4>
<p>Message us and maybe! We try to keep the information and CATE as relevant as possible and so we try not to focus on really niche things. One thing CATE will never have a page on is training methods outside of mentioning what tools are banned by law. I am not a qualified dog trainer or behaviourist and so no recommendations or training advice (besides go speak to a qualified dog trainer) will ever be given through CATE. </p>
      <h4>Can I help with CATE?</h4>
<p>By interacting in discussion, sharing posts and using our sub-projects you help CATE and others out. We do not accept donations as we are not an organisation and we have no financial needs at this time.</p>
