What is CATE?

CATE or Canine Access To Education is a project by me, ShibiTCT. It is meant to act as a resource for people to find out more about assistance dogs and to help Disabled people find an Assistance dog provider, organisation or someone who can help with assistance dog training.
The project is currently run just by me but I rely heavily on the input of other people to help make sure the site is as best quality as it possibly can be. 



About me
I am a 17 yro Disabled person who is Autistic and has Fibromyalgia. Assistance Dogs have been a special interest of mine for ~2 years which has made me intensily interested in the area.
It has allowed me to explore the assistance dog world before I was in the process of getting one myself which has benefited my knowlege of the area. Around a year ago I started helping
people on Twitter find assistance dog programmes, organisations and trainers that may be able to help them and later on compiled my first list of organisations. I found I enjoyed helping
people navigate the assistance dog world there isn't a lot of information easily available or personal experiences with assistance dogs unless you know which nook to look in.

The History of CATE

CATE was orginally going to be a CIC to help with the ongoing access issues with assistance dog partnerships and higher education hence 'Access To Education'. I decided that realistically and finacially that it wouldn't be the best to continue this way.
After I made the original organisation list, I decided that there was too many organisations to keep referring back to. I decided that a website would be a good way to publish and edit the list when need as I already had basic HTML and W3.CSS skills. From there the project evolved to what it is today.
