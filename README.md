Canine Access to Education is a project developed by ShibiTCT. The aim of CATE is to educate the public on assistance dogs and to find assistance dog providers to help Disabled people within the UK. There are additional sub-projects attatched to CATE including 'Give a dog a sign' , a sign campaign to help distribute information and more specifically accurate signs to help promote public access for assistance dog teams. If you have any feedback or corrections please put it in discussions or issues.
